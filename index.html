        <div class="about-me-section">
            <p>
                &emsp;Back in 2017, I wanted to load custom open-source software <a href="https://www.magiclantern.fm/" target="_blank">Magic Lantern</a> on to my Canon DSLR camera to gain custom features to make videos. 
                The developer recognized the potential of large CMOS sensors for videos and the lack of features given to stock cameras.  I knew cameras, but didn't know code.
                The potential of writing programs to make features excited me and drove me to focus on programming.  Always been interested in mathematics, logic, and computers, programming became a true passion and the end is history.
            </p>
            <p>  
                &emsp;More recently, I graduated from University of California, Santa Cruz and have been working as a software engineer.
                My main focus has been in full-stack development, working with tested languages, tools, and cloud services.
                While I mostly work with web technologies, I'm open to solving problems with any tools that gets the job done.                
                With my current position at iBroadcast, a small startup, I am developing music-centric, multi-platform applications.
            </p>
            <p>        
                &emsp;As I advance in my career, I want to continue working innovative, whilest sharing knowledge through teaching and mentorship.
                Outside of work, I enjoy the outdoors, martial arts, photography, and traveling.
